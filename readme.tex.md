Notations in Mathematica files: c[a] = \[Theta][a] = $\theta^a(e)$, and p[a] = $p^a(e)$

"JJ1.wl", "JJPhi1.wl", and "Trans1new.wl" store the formulae for matrices $J$, $\tilde{J}$ and $T$. 

"data.zip" stores all needed data for compute Thiemann's Lorenztian Hamiltonian. 

"J.nb" is the Mathematica file for computing matrices $J$ and $\tilde{J}$.

"new poisson_1.nb" is the Mathematica file for compute Poisson algebra of $\theta^a(e)$ and $p^a(e)$.

"trans_new1.nb" computes the matrix $T$ in the classical EOMs and demonstrates that the EOMs is equivalent to Hamiltonian equations. It also includes the expansion of $T$ in terms of $\mu$ for the lattice continuum limit.

"action.nb" computes the time continuous limit of the action, and the Poisson algebra between $X^a$ and $\theta^a$.

"ctHL.nb" computes the space continuum limit of the extrinsik curvature $K_i^a$ (stored in "kia.wl") and Thiemann's Lorenztian Hamiltonian.
